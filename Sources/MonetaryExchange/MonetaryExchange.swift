/// `Exchange` provides exchange rates between currencies. It can also convert `MonetaryAmount` values into
/// those of different `Currency` values.
///
/// ## Decoding a Fixer.io JSON response
/// An `Exchange` can be decoded directly from a standard [Fixer.io](https://fixer.io/) _Latest Rates_ JSON response.
/// See [Fixer API Documentation](https://fixer.io/documentation#latestrates) for more information about its API usage.
///
/// ### Example
///
///     let exchange = try? JSONDecoder().decode(Exchange.self, from: fixerResponseData)
///
/// Alternatively, an `Exchange` can be constructed with a base currency and a dictionary of currency-rate pairs.
///
/// ## Cross-rates
///
/// If converting between two currencies which neither are the base currency, but each have a rate against the base currency,
/// then a cross-rate will be produced.
///
/// For example, if the base currency is _EUR_ but a rate for _GBP to USD_ is requested, a cross-rate will be used. i.e. _GBP to EUR to USD_.
///
/// See the Collins Dictionary definition of [Cross-Rate](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cross-rate)
/// for more information.
